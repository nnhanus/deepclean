Hey there!

Thanks again for helping out with our ocean cleanup. There's 5.25 trillion pieces of garbage out here, so what we are doing today will barely make a dent- but every piece counts!

Your bag can only hold 8 pieces of trash, so when it's full come back up here and dump it in the bin.

Woah, nice job!

Your bag is looking full!

I appreciate your effort, but you can do better.

We've only got time for this last dive, so make it count!


Plastics are a big catalyst for climate change. They are made from fossil fuels, take a long time to decompose, and emit greenhouse gasses as they do. 

They also interfere with the oceans capacity to absorb carbon dioxide from the air. More CO2 in the atmosphere means more CO2 in the waters and a higher water acidity. 

These conditions are rapidly killing our coral reefs and threatening the aquatic biodiversity. By 2050 scientists believe that the oceans will be too hostile for coral to survive. It happens very quickly. 

I started this ocean clean up mission in 2019 and this is what it looked like then.

You'll see how much it's changed when you jump in. As more trash stays in the ocean, the more the coral reefs and its aquatic inhabitants die off.

Thanks again for helping out with the clean up! We'd love to have you back out here again sometime.
